🚢 Titanic Dataset - Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📌 Project Overview

This project is part of Task 02 from my internship, where I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset (from Kaggle). The goal was to explore relationships between variables, clean messy data, and identify patterns and trends that influenced passenger survival.

🛠️ Steps Performed
1. Data Cleaning

Handled missing values (Age, Cabin, Embarked).

Converted categorical variables into meaningful numerical values.

Removed duplicate and irrelevant records.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed survival rate by gender, class, and age group.

Explored relationships between features like fare, family size, and survival.

Created visualizations (bar plots, histograms, heatmaps) to identify trends.

3. Key Insights

Women and children had higher chances of survival compared to men.

Passengers in 1st class survived at a much higher rate than those in 3rd class.

Fare and Pclass strongly influenced survival probability.

📊 Tech Stack

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas & NumPy (data cleaning & manipulation)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualizations)

🚀 How to Run the Project



Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook "Taitanic Task.ipynb"


Run the notebook cells to view analysis and visualizations.
